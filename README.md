# **AI-Based Harassment Detector for Social Media**

This project implements an AI-based machine learning model designed to detect and classify misogynistic, abusive, and harmful comments directed at women on social media platforms. The system identifies inappropriate content in real-time, enabling further moderation actions. Built using traditional machine learning techniques, the model focuses on accurate classification to support safer online environments.

## **Installation**

To get this project up and running, you’ll need Python installed on your system. We’ll also be using a virtual environment to keep all the dependencies organized (trust me, it’s way cleaner that way!). Just follow the steps below to get everything set up and ready for action.

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to get the project running locally on your machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the project to your local machine with this command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Next, head into the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a fresh virtual environment to keep your project dependencies clean and isolated:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Now, activate the virtual environment to make sure all the dependencies get installed in the right place:

- On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **MacOS**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 5. Install Dependencies

With your virtual environment up and running, install all the necessary dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **Running the Model**

Once everything is set up, you're ready to run the model:

- To **train** the model and understand how it works, run this command:

  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```

- To **test** the model and check out its performance, execute:

  ```bash
  python test_model.py
  ```
