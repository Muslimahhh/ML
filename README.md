## **Installation**

To use this project, youâ€™ll need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, this project uses a virtual environment to manage dependencies. You can easily set up and install the necessary dependencies by following the instructions below.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to set up the project locally on your machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Once cloned, navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd your-repo
```

### 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

Create a new virtual environment to isolate your project dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

### 4. Activate the Virtual Environment

Activate the virtual environment to ensure that the dependencies are installed in an isolated environment:

- On **Windows**:

  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

- On **MacOS**:

  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

### 5. Install Dependencies

Install all required dependencies using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository. Run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## **Running the Model**

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the model.

- To **train** the model and get an understanding of how it works, execute:

  ```bash
  python train_model.py
  ```

- To **test** the model and see how it performs, execute:

  ```bash
  python test_model.py
  ```

## **Google Colab Setup**

To run the project on Google Colab, you can use the following steps:

1. **Open Google Colab**: Go to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).

2. **Open from GitHub**:
   - Click `File` > `Open notebook`.
   - Choose the `GitHub` tab and paste the URL of your repository: `https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git`.

3. **Install Dependencies**: Once the notebook is loaded in Google Colab, install the required dependencies by running:

   ```python
   !pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Model**

  After the dependencies are installed, you can execute the model's code as you would in a local setup.
